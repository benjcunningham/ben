Personal R package of [Ben Cunningham](http://www.linkedin.com/in/cunninghamben).

This repository is a compilation of functions that I find useful. It is inspired by [Hilary Parker's](http://hilaryparker.com/) article [Personal R Packages](http://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/). To get started creating your own packages, I recommend [her tutorial](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/).

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("benjcunningham/ben")
```

## Usage tips
The following options should be set in `.Rprofile` to customize the default behaviour of some functions.

* `ben.alarms`: Directory of sound assets; for example `~/R/alarms/`
